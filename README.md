This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

# TestFlight Deployment

To prepare and submit FetchQuest to TestFlight for testing, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have an Apple Developer account
2. Set up your app in App Store Connect
3. Configure your `.env` file with all required environment variables

## Testing Critical Paths

Before building for TestFlight, run the critical path test script to make sure all essential functionality is working:

```sh
node scripts/test-critical-path.js
```

## Building for TestFlight

We've included a convenient build script for TestFlight. Simply run:

```sh
./scripts/build-testflight.sh
```

This will:
1. Install all dependencies
2. Set up CocoaPods for iOS
3. Verify environment variables
4. Trigger an EAS build for TestFlight

## Submitting to TestFlight

Once the build is complete, you can submit it to TestFlight with:

```sh
eas submit -p ios --latest
```

## Manual Build Process

If you prefer to run the steps manually:

1. Install EAS CLI if not already installed:
   ```sh
   npm install -g eas-cli
   ```

2. Build the app:
   ```sh
   eas build --platform ios --profile testflight
   ```

3. Submit to TestFlight:
   ```sh
   eas submit -p ios --latest
   ```

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
